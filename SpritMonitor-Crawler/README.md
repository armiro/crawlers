# Spritmonitor.de Crawler

This crawler crawls **spritmonitor.de** in the vehicle fueling records;
extracting useful data (e.g. trip_distance, driving_style, etc.) and
appends each record to `vehicle_name.csv` which is created in the
current path. See examples: `volkswagen_e_golf.csv` / `mitsubishi_imiev.csv`
